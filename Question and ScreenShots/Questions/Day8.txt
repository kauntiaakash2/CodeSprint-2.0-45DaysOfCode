Problem Statement

Tanvi has set a personal fitness goal to burn at least a certain number of calories, tracked over a
‘sequence of workout sessions. Each session burns a positive number of calories, stored in an array
‘She wants to determine the smallest number of consecutive sessions that together burn at least
target calories.

Write a program to help Tanvi find the minimum length of such a contiguous subarray. If there is
no valid subarray, return 0,

Input Format

‘An integer target — the minimum total calories to be burned.

‘An integer n— number of workout sessions.

‘An array sessions of n positive integers — calories bumed in each session.

Output Format

single integer — the minimal length of a contiguous subarray with sum > target.

Ino such subarray exists, output 0.

Example

Input 1

target = 7 sessions = 2, 3,1, 2.4.3]

Output 1

2

Explanation

The subarray [4, 3] sums to 7 and is the shortest such subarray.

Input 2

target = 4 sessions = [1, 4,4]

Output 2

1

Input 3

target = 11 sessions = 11,1, 1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output 3

o

# Problem Statement

Problem Statement
Anubhav is preparing for a public speaking competition. The night before the event, he wrote

down the key sentence of his speech in a hurry. The problem? He scribbled it down in the wrong
word order, with extra spaces, and even left some leading or tr

ing spaces.

Now he wants to reverse the order of words in his sentence so it reads properly in his final script.
You're given a string speechLine that represents what Anubhav originally wrote. A word is
defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in the sentence are separated by at
least one space, and there might be multiple spaces between words or on the edges.

Your task is to help Anubhav clean up the sentence by:

Reversing the order of the words.

Removing any leading, trailing, or extra spaces.

Ensuring that words are separated by exactly one space.

Input Format

A single line of text speechLine — Anubhav's original sentence.

(1 < length < 104)

The sentence may include letters, digits, and spaces, and will contain at least one word.
Output Format

A single line — the cleaned-up version of Anubhav's sentence with:
Words in reverse order,

Exactly one space between words,

No leading or trailing spaces.

Examples

Input 1:
speechLine = “iam coding daily in codesprint”
Output 1:

codesprint in daily coding am i

Input 2:

speechLine = “ there is no heart for me like yours *
Output 2:

yours like me for heart no is there
