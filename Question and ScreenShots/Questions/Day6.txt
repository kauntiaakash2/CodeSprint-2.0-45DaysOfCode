Problem 1: Jewel Stones Counter

Problem Statement:
Rahil has a collection of stones he found during his hiking trip. Among them, some stones are actually precious jewels gifted to him by his grandmother.
Each type of jewel is represented by a unique character in a string called jewels.
His entire stone collection is represented by another string called stones.
Each character in the stones string represents one stone that Rahil has.
Your task is to help Rahil count how many of the stones in his collection are actually jewels.
- Letters are case-sensitive. That means 'a' and 'A' are considered different types of stones.

Input:
A string jewels — the types of stones that are jewels.
A string stones — the stones Rahil has.

Output:
A single integer — the number of stones that are jewels.

Constraints:
1 ≤ jewels.length, stones.length ≤ 50
jewels and stones consist only of English letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
All characters in jewels are unique.

Example 1:
Input:
aA
aAAbbbb
Output:
3

Example 2:
Input:
z
ZZ
Output:
0

Explanation:
In Example 1, jewels = 'aA' and stones = 'aAAbbbb'. The jewels 'a' and 'A' appear 1 and 2 times respectively, for a total of 3 jewels.
In Example 2, jewel = 'z' and no matching stone in 'ZZ', so the result is 0.

Problem 2: Vowel-Starting Unique Patient Names

Problem Statement:
Dr. Kavya works at a busy hospital managing patient records. Every day, she receives a list of patient names who visited for checkups. Some patients come multiple times in the same day due to follow-ups.
Dr. Kavya wants to generate a list of unique patients she saw today, but only those whose names start with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).

Your task is to help Dr. Kavya:
1. Read the list of patient names for the day.
2. Identify all unique patient names that start with a vowel.
3. Print the count of such unique patients followed by their names in the order they first appeared.

Input:
An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of patient entries for the day.
Followed by n lines, each containing one patient name (lowercase English letters, no spaces).

Output Format:
First line: the count of unique patients whose names start with a vowel.
Next lines: the unique patient names starting with a vowel, printed in the order they first appeared.

Example Input:
8
arjun
rita
anita
arjun
omkar
priya
anita
uma

Example Output:
4
arjun
anita
omkar
uma

Explanation:
The list of patients is:
arjun, rita, anita, arjun, omkar, priya, anita, uma
The names starting with vowels are:
arjun, anita, omkar, uma
Duplicates are removed, preserving the order of first appearance.
So, the output is:
Count = 4
Names = arjun, anita, omkar, uma
