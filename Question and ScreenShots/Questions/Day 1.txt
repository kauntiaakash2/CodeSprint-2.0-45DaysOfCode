Question 1

Problem Statement Shivam loves ice cream. Every day after college, he visits the ice cream cart near the gate. Today, he has a few coins in his pocket and a fixed budget. There are different ice creams priced differently, but he wants to buy only one that fits exactly into his budget.

Write a function that takes an integer budget and a list of integers iceCreamPrices, and returns true if there exists at least one ice cream whose price is exactly equal to the budget, otherwise return false.

Input An integer budget where budget ≥ 0 A list of integers iceCreamPrices (1 ≤ length ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ price ≤ 10⁴) Output A boolean value:

true if there's a price that matches the budget false otherwise Example Example 1 Input:

budget = 30 iceCreamPrices = $10, 25, 30, 50]

Output:

true

Explanation: Shivam can buy the ice cream priced at 30, which matches his budget exactly.

Question 2

Problem Statement Vir is practicing archery. He takes n shots and records the score of each shot (an integer between 0 and 10). Now, Vir wants to know:

How many shots scored above or equal to 7 (considered a good shot) How many shots scored below 7 (considered a missed shot) Write a program that takes the number of shots and their scores, then prints the count of good shots and missed shots.

Input An integer n (number of shots), where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 An array of n integers representing scores of each shot (0 ≤ score ≤ 10) Output Two integers separated by a space:

Number of good shots (score ≥ 7) Number of missed shots (score < 7) Example Example 1 Input:

5 8 6 7 10 4

Output:

3 2

Explanation: Good shots: 8, 7, 10 → 3 shots Missed shots: 6, 4 → 2 shots
