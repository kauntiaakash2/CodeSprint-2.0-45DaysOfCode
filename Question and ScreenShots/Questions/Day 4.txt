DAY 4 Problem 1

X-Pattern Matrix Puzzle

Problem Statement
Prateek, a curious puzzle designer, has created a mysterious X-pattern puzzle for a coding event.
The puzzle involves printing a square matrix of size n × n, where:

Main diagonal elements (i == j) are filled with numbers from 1 to n, increasing row by row.
Anti-diagonal elements (i + j == n - 1) are filled with numbers from n to 1, decreasing row by row.
All other elements are replaced with a dash "-".

If a cell is on both the main and anti-diagonal (i.e., the center of the matrix), the same value will be
printed from both rules.

Input Format
A single odd integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the size of the square matrix.

Output Format
Print n lines, each containing n elements separated by a single space.
No trailing spaces at the end of any line.

Example

Input
5

Output
1 - - - 5
- 2 - 4 -
- - 3 - -
- 2 - 4 -
1 - - - 5

Explanation
Main Diagonal (i == j): Values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Anti-Diagonal (i + j == n - 1): Values are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
The center cell matrix[2][2] lies on both diagonals and gets the value 3.

Constraints
n is always an odd number.
3 ≤ n ≤ 1000

DAY 4 Problem 2

Zig-Zag Marathon Pattern
Patten | Condition | Loops | Strings

# Problem Statement

Abhik is tracking his marathon training progress using a special zig-zag numeric wave chart for n
days. This chart reflects his trait

On odd-numbered days (1, 3, 5, ..), he performs high-intensity workouts, so the row prints intensity and cooldown phases:
increasing numbers starting from 1 up to the day number.

On even-numbered days (2, 4, 6, ..), he focuses on cooldown and recovery, so the row prints decreasing numbers starting from the day number down to 1.

The pattern should be:

-Center-aligned relative to the longest row (day n).
-Each number must be separated by exactly 3 spaces for clarity.
-If n > 10, print a motivational message before the chart:
-Abhik’s marathon journey intensifies! Let’s see his detailed zig-zag pattern:bh

-After printing the chart, print the total number of values printed in the format:
Total numbers printed: X

*Input Format
-A single integer n (1 < n < 20) — the number of days Abhik trained.

*Output Format
-(Optional) Motivational message if n > 10.
-The zig-zag numeric wave chart.
-The final statement: Total numbers printed: X

*Constraints
l<=n<= 20
