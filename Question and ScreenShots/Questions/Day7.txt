Problem Statement

Kavya, a software engineer, developed a smart home security system that logs movement as a
binary string for each day:

*1" indicates someone entered or exited the house.

"@' means no movement was detected during that time interval.

She wants to analyze the log to count the number of distinct segments of movement recorded in
aday.

A segment of movement is defined as a continuous sequence of *1's that is either:
Surrounded by *@"s on both sides, or

At the start or end of the string.

Your task is to determine how many such segments are present in the binary log.

Input Format

A single binary string log of length n (1 < n < 100), consisting only of "8" and ‘1* characters.
Output Format

A single integer: the number of movement segments recorded.

Example

Input

0110011101010

Output

4

Explanation

In the binary log 0110011101010, the movement segments are:

11 (starts at index 2-3)

111 (starts at index 6-8)

1 (at index 10)

1 (at index 12)

Each group of consecutive *1's is considered a segment only if it’s not part of another segment,
thus totaling 4 segments.

Constraints

1 < Length of binary string < 100

2 Problem Statement

Problem Statement

Diyasha is a young entrepreneur tracking the daily prices of a particular stock over several days.
Each day's price is recorded in an array.

‘She wants to maximize her profit by choosing exactly one day to buy and a future day to sell
the stock (buy before selling). She is allowed to make only one transaction.

However, Diyasha has set a condition: she will only execute the trade if her profitis at least 2
units, if no profit of atleast 2 is possible, she won't trade.

Your task is to help Diyasha find the maximum profit she can make following this rule. If the
profits less than 2, return 0.

Input Format

‘An integer n (2 < n £ 100), the number of days.

A sequence of n space-separated integers representing the stock prices for each day.

Output Format

single integer representing the maximum profit (2 2), or 0 ifno such profit is possible.
Example Input 1

6

715364

Example Output 1

5

Explanation

Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 5.

Example Input 2

5

33445

Example Output 2

2

Explanation

Buy on day 1 or 2 (price = 3), sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit,
Example Input 3

4

5566

Example Output 3

0

Explanation

Maximum profit is 1 (buy at 5, sell at 6), but since its less than 2, output is 0.
Constraints

2<n<100

Prices are integers
